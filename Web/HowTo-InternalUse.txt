What to do, if you want an internal deployment:

Change (optional) the following files/values:

src/at/gv/wien/PortableSigner/i18n_de.properties    HomepageURL=...
src/at/gv/wien/PortableSigner/Version.java          internaltag = "-Org"

you can change anything else like texts and default logo also, ...
These things are typically in i18n_??.properties or in Signatureblock.properties

After this compile and package the system.

The easiest way for Deployment on Windows is to take the 
PortableSigner-Windows.zip from your dist/ship directory anf unpack it under a
directory on the PC's. It doesn't need anything else like Registry except Java 
and the JCE unrestrictes Extension installed
